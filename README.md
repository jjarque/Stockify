# Stockify

Stockify is a modern inventory management application designed to help businesses efficiently track and control their stock levels. The app provides a user-friendly interface for managing products, monitoring stock movements, and generating insightful reports.

## Features

- **Product Management:** Add, update, and remove products with details like name, SKU, category, quantity, price, and supplier information.
- **Stock Control:** Record stock entries and exits to keep inventory levels accurate in real-time.
- **Low Stock Alerts:** Receive notifications when product quantities fall below a defined minimum threshold.
- **Reports and Analytics:** Generate reports to analyze inventory movements, identify top-selling products, and track stock trends.
- **User Roles and Permissions:** Differentiate access levels for administrators and standard users to ensure secure and controlled management.
- **Dashboard:** Overview of current inventory status, low stock warnings, and recent activities.

## How It Works

1. **Adding Products:** Users can register new products by entering relevant details.
2. **Updating Inventory:** Stock quantities are adjusted by logging entries (incoming stock) and exits (sales or usage).
3. **Monitoring:** Stockify continuously monitors inventory levels and alerts users to restock when necessary.
4. **Reporting:** Users can generate reports to make informed decisions about inventory management.
